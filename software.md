I'm a developer and sometimes work on projects in my spare time. The following 
projects are relevant to amateur radio:

* [hamclubbot](https://github.com/dongola7/hamclubbot) - A Discord bot
  intended for use in servers for Amateur Radio Clubs. Provides a series of
  useful tools for managing the club, looking up weather conditions for
  radio operation, etc.
* [ADIF Tools](https://github.com/dongola7/adif_tools) - Tcl package used for
  processing ADIF files
* [qrz-api](https://github.com/dongola7/qrz-api) - Tcl package used for querying
  the QRZ callbook API
